        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a structural engineer shaped by early encounters with earthquake sites and a deep fascination with traditional Chinese timber architecture. My work focuses on performance-based seismic engineering, structural analysis, and the resilience embedded in ancient wooden buildings. I’m particularly interested in how traditional joinery systems and historical structural logic can inspire modern design strategies.</p>
        <p>I have completed projects in nonlinear analysis, steel moment frame evaluation, and seismic performance assessment using ASCE‑7 and ASCE‑41 methodologies. My academic path has taken me from UC Davis to Berkeley, where I continue exploring the intersection of cultural heritage and modern engineering.</p>
